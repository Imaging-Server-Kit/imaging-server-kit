# 🪐 Imaging Server Kit

Turn Python-based image processing workflows into **algorithms** that gain extra functionalities.

- [**Turn your algorithms into web servers**]() and run computations from [QuPath](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/qupath-extension-serverkit), [Napari](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/napari-serverkit), or [Python](08_python) via HTTP requests.


- [**Generate dock widgets**]() to run your algorithms interactively in Napari.



- Run your algorithms [**tile-by-tile**]() on the input data.



- [**Stream results**]() to inspect them in real-time.
